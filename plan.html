<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name: Donald Cull</strong></p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this website is to increase Slammers' customer base by at least 50%.
    This website is needed to increase awareness of Slammers' products and services provided.
    Slammers will benefit from the website by an increased footfall of new customers, and an improved awareness for existing customers of the products and services they provide.
  </p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Slammers already have 100 people attend their games per week.  Based on this metric we can approximate that there will a total of 1200 people using Slammers' facilities per quarter.
  For the Slammers website to be a success this total would have to 1800 per quarter.
  Because volleyball is a weekly sport there are many regular customers and returning customers; success would be difficult to determine on this metric alone.
  The website's success can be measured by monitoring the amount of customers who sign up through the online form. However, this doesn't include customers who view Slammers' website and then sign up over the phone, by email or in person.
    These customers can be asked upon sign-up by Slammers' admin where they had first heard of Slammers; if through the website, they can be added to the customer increase.
  Spectators and customers using the bar facilities who have first heard of Slammers through the website can also be counted as a success.
</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    The target audience of this website is families with children of ages 15-18.
      The existing customer age range is 35 - 50. Because the client's target audience for new customers is high school age (15 -30), the website is designed to reflect this.
    A call to action "Bring the whole family" is designed for parents signing up their own family members, perhaps children without phone numbers, emails etc.  The theme of the website is family friendly with no explicit or irrelevant
    detail.  Images and colours used are bright and colourful, indicating that the business is a happy and safe place to visit and play volleyball.
    Information is laid out clearly and website navigation isn't confusing for the customer, which will appeal to all age groups.
