<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name: Donald Cull</strong></p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of this website is to increase Slammers customer base by at least 50%.
    This website is needed to increase awareness of Slammers products and services provided.
    Slammers will benefit from this website by the customers increased awareness of their business and therefore the products and services the customers pay money for.
  </p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    The websites success can be measured by asking first time customers how they found out about the business when visiting.
    Customers that discovered the business through the website can be counted as a success.
    If Slammers receives 50 new customers that have discovered the business through the new website, the website will then have accomplished the goal.
  </p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    The target audience of this website is families as volleyball is a family sport.
    By targeting families, we can include 35 to 50 aged players, young families, kids in high school which is the clients desired target group and the majority of customers.
    Not sure how the design will cater for this group yet???
